# Predictive Modeling for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Using Machine Learning and Cloud-Based Solutions 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals. Using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, it leverages a diverse set of features, such as clinical metrics, medical test results, and lifestyle factors, to predict the presence of CVD. The project utilizes tools like Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, and Azure Databricks to streamline the data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training pipeline, ensuring efficiency, scalability, and security. The primary objectives include accurate risk classification, seamless data management, and comprehensive model development, with the goal of aiding healthcare providers in early CVD detection, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.










## Dataset

The dataset includes various features categorized as: 

- Objective Features: Attributes such as age, height, weight, and gender. 
- Examination Features: Clinical metrics like systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels. 
- Subjective Features: Lifestyle factors, including smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity. 
The target variable, cardio, indicates the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, coded 
as binary (1 for presence, 0 for absence).

## Project Structure

#### 1. Data Ingestion
Collect data from a public source (e.g., GitHub repository) and ingest it into the cloud environment.
#### 2. Data Storage
Store the ingested data in Azure Data Lake for further processing and analysis.
#### 3. Computing on Databricks
Set up a Databricks cluster and use it for distributed computing, model training, and evaluation.
#### 4. Data Preprocessing
Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
#### 5. Model Building
Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) on the preprocessed data.
#### 6. Model Comparison
Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.
